# AP World History Final Project
This is the creative portion of my final project for AP World History; a PWA showcasing reasons for the decline of the Western Roman Empire.

## Contents
The project contains the hallmark reasons why the Roman Empire fell: invasions from Germanic tribes, the collapse of Roman culture, and the collapse of the state's centralized authority.
