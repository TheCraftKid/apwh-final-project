# AP World History Final Project (Defunct)
**For the updated, fully realized end result of this project, see [Project Passport](https://github.com/TheCraftKid/project-passport).**

This is the creative portion of my final project for AP World History; a PWA showcasing reasons for the decline of the Western Roman Empire.

## Contents
The project contains the hallmark reasons why the Roman Empire fell: invasions from Germanic tribes, the collapse of Roman culture, and the collapse of the state's centralized authority.

## How to use
To run from source, clone the repository, then run `npm install` and `bower install` in the root directory to install dependencies. Run `polymer serve` to start the local development server.
