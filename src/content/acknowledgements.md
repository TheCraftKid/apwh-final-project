I'd like to thank all the contributors of open-source projects that made this website available along with my AP World History teacher, Mr. Barber, for giving me the freedom to create whatever effectively told the story about the fall of the Roman Empire.

## Polymer Project
[Polymer 2.0](https://www.polymer-project.org/), a framework to was used to make this project. It can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer),  under the BSD License.

## Firebase Hosting
While not open-source, [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting/) lets one easily host a HTTPS-secured, CDN-cached website without having to secure a domain name, perfect for progressive web apps.

## Visual Studio Code
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was the only IDE used to create the web app. It's great for web development and even understands markdown and supports many more functions. It can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) under the MIT License.

## Web App Manifest Generator
This [Web App Manifest Generator](https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com/) is great for generating web app manifests and properly sized app icons for progressive web apps.

# Inspiration
The official government websites of Germany, France, and the UK provided ample inspiration to what a Roman government website would look like before its decline. [No comment.]
